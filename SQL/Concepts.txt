//Common Table Expression
A CTE (Common Table Expression) in SQL Server is a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. It's defined using the WITH keyword and helps make queries more readable and maintainable—especially when working with complex logic like recursive queries, ranking, or subqueries.

-- CTE
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(@N INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @Result INT;

    WITH RANKED_SALARY AS (
        SELECT SALARY, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS salaryrank
        FROM Employee
    )
    SELECT @Result = SALARY
    FROM RANKED_SALARY
    WHERE salaryrank = @N;

    RETURN @Result;
END


//OFFSET LIMIT
In SQL Server, you can use OFFSET and FETCH clauses to paginate results — i.e., skip a certain number of rows and then fetch a limited number of rows.
These clauses are typically used with ORDER BY, which is mandatory when using OFFSET.


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM your_table
ORDER BY some_column
OFFSET @Offset ROWS
FETCH NEXT @Limit ROWS ONLY;
